publish-papers
==============

I'm using github here to publish these (my) writings.  Don't worry about your right to use these papers.  Download any of them to your heart's content, but as always with any writings of others, please don't plagarize, and cite your sources.

(If your reaction to the foregoing was, "Duh!", then you are on the right track.)  :)

Cheers!  --Rick
